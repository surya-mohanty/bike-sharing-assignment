## Problem Statement

You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
Major Driving factor which can be used to predict the demand for shared bikes are below variables 
  1. yr

  4. windspeed
  5. summer
  6. winter
  7. September
  8. Sunday
  9. weathersit_moderate
